<h2>Flavor Profile </h2>
The primary flavor in G FUEL Castro’s Guava is guava – sweet with a tropical taste. It has hints of pineapple as well that add some tartness to the mix but overall this brew has a very pleasing balance between sweet and sour flavors. The end result is something light yet flavorful enough to satisfy your cravings for something refreshingly different than what other energy drinks offer up when it comes to taste profiles.
    
The aftertaste isn't overly strong either; just pleasant without being too overpowering or artificial tasting like many other popular brands can be sometimes. Additionally, its moderate carbonation enhances its already great flavor profile by adding depth without being excessive or unpleasant at all!
